**Feedback:**
I commend your commitment, especially in maintaining focus for extended periods like 16-hour study sessions. I suggest breaking your study sessions into shorter, manageable intervals with defined breaks to maintain productivity and motivation. I recommend exploring techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or setting up a reward system for reaching smaller goals. I note your struggle with motivation; consider keeping a journal to track accomplishments and feelings, providing insight into your progress. Finally, I suggest developing a support system or seeking mentorship to aid in moments when giving up feels tempting.
